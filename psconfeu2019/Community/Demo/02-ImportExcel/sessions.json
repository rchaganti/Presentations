This session will be centered around memory usage patterns and its effect on performance. As a case study we look at Import-CSV and the Json cmdlets to see the effect on memory allocation and GC pressure. By changing the code to be allocate less, we can show significant performance improvements. We will touch on the Garbage Collector, it’s generational behavior and take a high level view of what the garbage collector needs to do. The session will introduce dotMemory – a tool to analyze the memory allocation patterns of a program, and the cost of these allocations. In the end we’ll go nuclear – Rewriting PSObject to use significantly less memory. This is achieved by taking a look at the memory layout of a PSObject, and using that knowledge to remove unnecessary sub-objects, saving on the object headers, shared lock objects, less pointer chasing etc. The beginning of this session should be easy to follow along for the more technically interested part of the community.

Come experience a technical buffet of in-the-wild malicious PowerShell payloads from 4+ years of Incident Responses \u0026 see why PowerShell’s defensive visibility is now driving many attackers away from PowerShell. For over a decade PowerShell has empowered administrators, DevOps practitioners and automation enthusiasts to accomplish significant tasks with relative ease. However, malicious threat actors have also harnessed PowerShell’s capabilities by writing extensive offensive tools and frameworks in PowerShell.  The PowerShell team has countered these malicious trends with adding numerous defensive enhancements to PowerShell including extremely deep logging visibility (like ScriptBlock, Module and Transcription logging) as well as blocking capabilities and interfaces like the AntiMalware Scan Interface (AMSI).  This talk draws from over four years of Incident Response experience to lay out a technical buffet of in-the-wild malicious PowerShell payloads and techniques. In addition to diving deep into the mechanics of each malicious example, this presentation will highlight forensic artifacts, detection approaches and the deep visibility that the latest versions of PowerShell provides security practitioners to defend their organizations against the latest attacks that utilize PowerShell.  So if you are new to security or just want to learn about how attackers have used PowerShell in their attacks, then this talk is for you. If you want to see what obfuscated and multi-stage, evasive PowerShell-based attacks look like under the microscope of PowerShell deep inspection capabilities, this talk is for you. And if you want to see why these security advancements to PowerShell are causing many attackers to shift their tradecraft development away from PowerShell, this talk is for you.",

Whether it\u0027s for configuration management (Ansible, Chef attributes, Puppet Hiera, DSC Datum), CI tools configuration (Azure DevOps, AppVeyor, Gitlab CI) or other tools enabling DevOps practices (gitversions, Test-Kitchen), YAML is growing in popularity.

In this session, we\u0027ll demystify the format, show where and why it really shines, along with the existing PowerShell tooling to create, modify and consume YAML files and explore some use cases you might come across.   After you watched this, you will be able to write YAML files painlessly and understand how they relate to PowerShell objects when using the powershell-yaml module. You will get familiar with the manipulation possible, how to serialise objects to YAML, update your files, and understand some differences with the more common JSON and PSD1 format, along with the benefits of YAML in a DevOps context. You will also get a quick overview of some advanced usage of YAML for configuration data, similar to what Puppet Hiera uses, made possible by the Datum module.

In this talk we\u0027ll abstract away common patterns into reusable PowerShell tools and discuss their benefits .NET Regex is an awesomely powerful string matching engine, and it offers us the ability to quickly parse and test variable string input. But it\u0027s learning curve is steep, it\u0027s features mindbending and convoluting, and we all know how you can never remember that one construct that you\u0027re sure what just do the trick! So let\u0027s have a look at meaningful ways to incorporate regex\u0027 power into more user-friendly PowerShell-based utilities! I expect this presentation to be more fun than technically enlightening (assuming the audience will find mind-bending regex tricks \"fun\")",

Taking a common software development approach we are going to look at each phase and see which tools can be used to accomplish each phase. The ideas are based on the lessons learned of an actual infrastructure as code project.  \t\t # Abstract This session will dive deep into the testing approach of an infrastructure as code project written in PowerShell. We will create a PowerShell module that will allow us to deploy an infrastructure as a service resource using a template. The solution will be fully tested, including unit test of functions, templates, integration and an end to end test.   # Tools Leveraging tools like Pester, Script Analyzer, Best Practices Checker, Azure DevOps and custom scripts to create a mature and reliable infrastructure as code solution.  # Objectives At the end of this talk you will be able to:   *   create your own test suite for your infrastructure as code project.  *  can articulate why infrastructure as code testing is necessary and can increase you quality of delivery.  *  get started with your next infrastructure as code project quicker and much more mature.",

Pester assertions are great, but often they are very limiting. When testing something out of ordinary, people often fallback to using Should -Be $true, which makes their tests fail with something like \"Expected True but got False.\". This message does not describe any context of why the test failed, and the test code itself also leaves a lot to be desired in terms of readability. To avoid this I will show you how to extend the Should keyword with custom operators such as Should -BeInRange -Min 0 -Max 10, to better represent what you are testing. This will also help you to get rid of a lot of boiler plate code. And then we will have a look at writing your own assertion suite, testing it and plugging it into Pester.",

We will cover user accounts with the same password, people who have used the same password multiple times (Admins resetting the password to the same, not adhering to the AD password policy). All the extracted data is stored in SQLite, to ease analysis.

This can make it more difficult to grasp as it might not easily relate to how someone is currently working or has been working, showing the wrong way to do things is more approachable as everyone was a beginner at some point and many people made the same mistakes. Taking this one step further and providing reasoning why one approach is the wrong or worse way to handle something can also allow people to make an informed decision on using that approach anyway, if their circumstances require it.",

Join this session and discover how to create your own images with PowerShell, DSC, Chocolatey and Hashicorp Packer! The concept of OS Golden Images isn\u0027t new, and most seasoned sysadmins have used tools like Ghost, Acronis or just captured images using MDT. But modern practices - as described in Microsoft\u0027s Release Pipeline Model whitepaper - apply here: every changes and all automation should start from source control.   Unfortunately some of the old tools aren\u0027t suited for modern practices, or need to be rediscovered, like DISM. In this session we\u0027ll explore how to use the common tools from the modern SysAdmin\u0027s toolbelt (PowerShell, DSC, Chocolatey) to manage OS image creation in a pipeline using Packer. After attending this session you\u0027ll understand the principles driving this approach and how Hashicorp Packer, the renowned cross platform OSS tool, help with those challenges.   You\u0027ll see how we can use PowerShell and DSC to customise the OS configuration, and pre-install Software with Chocolatey - a Software Management tool - as part of the Image pipeline. Finally, we\u0027ll see how we can export different virtual machine templates with the same OS configuration, ready to be used in virtualisation or cloud platforms such as vSphere, HyperV, Azure or AWS.",

        "Description":  "Attackers obfuscate PowerShell to evade rigid detections. With recent improvements in obfuscation detection, savvy attackers have started to obfuscate less \u0026 more selectively to avoid detection. Come learn how PesterSec leverages Pester \u0026 ScriptAnalyzer to detect minimally-obfuscated PowerShell. Over the years as attackers have increasingly used PowerShell as an important piece of their offensive toolkit, the PowerShell Team has countered by building deep inspection capabilities into PowerShell that are not found in any other scripting language. However, as defenders began using this new visibility and significantly improving their detection of malicious PowerShell usage, attackers adapted their techniques. As attackers turned to the heavy usage of specific obfuscation techniques, like those found in Invoke-Obfuscation and Invoke-CradleCrafter, to target certain aspects of PowerShell’s ScriptBlock logging, defenders once again had to match this offensive shift with their own shift in detection methodology. Defenders have since turned to various data science approaches, like those built into Revoke-Obfuscation, to more robustly detect heavy PowerShell obfuscation. However, countering offensive projects like PSAmsi have enabled attackers to apply selective obfuscation in minimal quantities to evade specific A/V signatures while falling under the \"obfuscation threshold\" of newer data science approaches. Come learn how PesterSec combines the power of ScriptAnalyzer and Pester to perform context-specific detections of minimally-obfuscated PowerShell commands and scripts. These platforms also highlight the ease of access to PowerShell’s Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for any PowerShell practitioner.",

As an example, we will look at Group-Object, which hadO(n^2 ), if the input data was unfortunate. After some changes it will beO(n lg?n). We will look at the different algorithms to understand why and how we get very different runtime performance before and after the change. We will also look at the formatting system, and some changes there where some client code used primitives that were existing, but poorly suited for the task. By dropping down a level and providing better primitives, in this case on PSObject, we can make significant performance improvements. The session will look at dotTrace – a tool to analyze runtime performance. Attendants will walk away from the talk with a better understanding of code constructs that can result in bad performance patterns.

We implemented infrastructure as code framework to deploy a fully tested solution to any Azure region available with a click of a button. What used to take weeks to build can now be scripted and deployed within hours. \u003e By viewing cloud computing as a starting point for IT automation, companies may be able to have it all: scalability, agility, flexibility, efficiency, and cost savings. But that’s only possible by building up both automation and cloud capabilities.” McKinsey # Abstract This talk will highlight lessons learned implementing an infrastructure as code project from scratch working with a team. You can expect to learn what challenges to be faced when pursuing a large scale automation project on Azure and which latest technologies the team used to tackle theses challenges. At the end of the talk you will be able to plan ahead for your Infrastructure as Code Project. You are going to be aware of and can avoid common pitfalls in an automation project. As well as learn how to use a \"blue print\" templates approach to deploy Azure resources on demand quickly, like Windows and Linux VMs that are fully tested contentiously. Also, you will be aware of what to consider when deploying large scale solutions, that takes nearly half a day to spin up. # Tools We will have hands on to Azure DevOps, different Infrastructure as Code tools like PowerShell Az module, ARM templates, Unit and Integration tests with Pester.

Or is your infrastructure quite complex, semi-chaotic one, where scripts run from many different places and do not have a single point of control? In this talk delegate Kirill Nikolaev demonstrates a simple solution for host maintenance which is suitable for each case and will make your life much easier.",

This session provides insights into designing a distributed, flexible, and secure operations validations framework. Performing Operations and diagnostics validation is a very important aspect of agile infrastructure development and monitoring. While the core principle of operations and diagnostics validation is about writing tests that are used to validate the functionality of the deployed infrastructure, it is equally important to ensure that the framework that is used for operations validation is distributed, flexible, and secure by design. This session provides insights into design of one such framework and walks through the design principles while providing real-world implementation examples. This session is not just about writing Pester tests but about making it secure and efficient to run those Pester tests for infrastructure validation in the context of Test-in-Production (TiP).",

        "Description":  "For years VMware has released a vSphere Hardening Guide to help keep environments secure. There has to be a better way though! Chef InSpec and its PowerShell integrations allow us to now apply and continually validate those settings with a tool every vSphere admin is familiar with, PowerCLI. vSphere security is always one of those “elephant in the room” type of topics. Everyone wants to do it, but no one knows how to get there consistently and painlessly. This session takes a look at the newly released integration between Chef InSpec and PowerShell, where we can turn your compliance into code! I’ll walk through how easy it is to install and configure InSpec, how to establish the PowerShell integration, then how we can use PowerCLI to apply settings from the vSphere Security Configuration Guide (formerly, vSphere Hardening Guide).",

After this talk the attendee will come away with an understanding of: * The difference between software installers and packages; * How to create a Chocolatey package using PowerShell, a Nuget specification file and the software binary that will install the software without clicking a single button! * How to package that \u0027special snowflake\u0027 software installer that just really wants to make you click some buttons! * How Chocolatey LOVES PowerShell. It does; * How to use Pester to test your packages; * How to be part of the community, share and collaborate by uploading your new package for the world to use! * What the package review process is, how it helps you and how it gives peace of mind to those downloading and using your package; * How to keep your packages constantly up to date without lifting a finger, using PowerShell goodness and the Chocolatey AU module; * How to keep the software on your computer continuously up to date and keep it secure; Learn how to create a Chocolatey package using your favourite scripting language (did I say Chocolatey LOVES PowerShell) sharing it, installing it and keeping it continuously up to date.

The AST can be daunting at first sight. This session will remove that fear and show how the AST really isn\u0027t scary. At the end of this session you will have a good understanding of how the AST works, and use this knowledge to write PSScriptAnalyzer rules or commands for PowerShell Editor Services. As a non-formally trained developer, I always thought the AST was daunting and scary. However, those fears once disappeared once I learned the fundamentals of what the AST is and how it is structured. This session will show you how the AST is built, as well as visualizing it with open source tools such as ShowPSAst and EditorASTProvider. We\u0027ll also look at different methods for parsing and searching PowerShell scripts for elements, as well as using this knowledge to write your own PSScriptAnalyzer rules or writing commands to manipulate scripts in VSCode via PowerShellEditorServices.",
